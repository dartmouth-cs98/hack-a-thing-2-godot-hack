# Hack-A-Thing-2
Repository for 2nd hack-a-thing, CS98

The Goal of this Hack-a-thing was to try a new game engine and see how well the 2D multiplayer worked on it.

I chose to explore Godot as an option. First, I had to learn about the game engine itself and how it worked.
I read through some of the documentation like this page: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.html

After reading a bit about the engine, I tried to create my first game by following this tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html

After finishing the above tutorial, I decided that I wanted to make something a bit more complex, so I looked up more tutorials and came accross this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QftpPI5iYrY

After finishing the platforming game, I decided to try out the multiplayer aspect of it. This part was difficult for me as I could not find any good tutorials online. I had to resort to a mixture of tutorials with already written code and the documentation found here https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html
Unfortunately, I was unable to get it to work.

I had to download a template of multiple player made by cobolfoo. It is called "Multiplayer Space Game". This template can be found in the "Space Game" branch of this repository.
I was able to connect multiple players on this game with just a local server.

After looking through the code, I think I understand a big better about the concept of how it works. It seems to be straightforward, but maybe someone with better knowledge of the syntax would find it easier, but I have always had a difficult time understanding servers and clients.

I hope my other group members had an easier time with the other game engines for getting multiplayer to work. We will discuss what we have found and choose the best game engine for us.
