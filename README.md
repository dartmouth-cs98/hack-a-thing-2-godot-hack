# Hack-A-Thing-2
Repository for 2nd hack-a-thing, CS98

The Goal of this Hack-a-thing was to try a new game engine and see how well the 2D multiplayer worked on it.

I chose to explore Godot as an option. First, I had to learn about the game engine itself and how it worked.
I read through some of the documentation like this page: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.html

After reading a bit about the engine, I tried to create my first game by following this tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html

After finishing the above tutorial, I decided that I wanted to make something a bit more complex, so I looked up more tutorials and came accross this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QftpPI5iYrY
